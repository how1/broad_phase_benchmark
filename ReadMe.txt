Benchmarking Suite for Collision Detection Algorithms

This repo is the code only. There is another repo with a zipped Unity folder. However, if you want to set up your own Unity scene follow these steps:

Open new Unity project
Copy/Paste all scripts from this repo into Assets folder
Create empty gameobject and add GameControl script
Create empty gameobject and add NarrowPhase, CreateObjects, Simple, SpatialMasking, SweepAndPrune, OctTreeAlg, and Bounds scripts
The scene should be able to run

Make adjustments using the GameControl object
